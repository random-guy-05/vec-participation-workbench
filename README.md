# VEC Participation Workbench

Offline-first tools and interactive learning simulations for joining, analyzing, and contributing to the Virtual Embryo Challenge community. The tools support submission planning, team coordination, study-record audits, community onboarding, safe help requests, compute planning, data handling, paired prediction diagnostics, spatial graph diagnostics, and task-metric interpretation.

Each tool runs in a browser with no account, server, analytics, dependency install, or data upload. User-entered information stays in the page until exported. The tools are planning aids; the official Challenge pages control if a rule or date changes.

The 21 core analysis cards in the catalog and the 29 original analysis pages offer Spanish and Simplified Chinese titles, descriptions, labels, and input guidance. Result summaries, validation messages, table columns, and data values remain in English to preserve stable technical identifiers; each page explains this before analysis. The selected interface language appears in the URL, and changing it does not clear entered inputs. The eight additional research-audit cards are listed in English in the catalog; their controls offer Spanish and Simplified Chinese. The Reference Match-Set Auditor, Scored Submission Budget Tracker, and Agent Run Lock & Evidence Record also have English, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese interfaces. The eight paired prediction diagnostics, eight spatial graph diagnostics, and Task Metric Lab are currently English-only.

## Run locally

Clone the repository and open `docs/index.html` or any `docs/tools/<name>/index.html` in a modern browser. The apps use only local HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They do not fetch Challenge data or send form contents anywhere.

## Task Metric Lab

The [Task Metric Lab](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/metric-lab/) currently contains twelve small calculators for per-metric skill scaling, weight checks, task-score aggregation, DES, DCS, MMD, CSS, PSS, TSR, SDD, ODS, and neighborhood fidelity. Each calculator links back to the official scoring reference and states where its small-data preview differs from the full scorer. Use synthetic or permitted data; the lab runs in the browser and does not upload inputs.

## Sources and maintenance

The current source links and the facts each tool uses are collected in [`SOURCES.md`](SOURCES.md). Recheck those official pages before relying on date- or rules-sensitive output. Last checked: 14 October 2026.

The analysis tools’ distinct purposes and neighboring community resources are mapped in [NOVELTY_MAP.md](NOVELTY_MAP.md).

## Interactive learning simulations

These deterministic, browser-local demonstrations make assumptions visible and help participants reason about common design and interpretation choices. They are not analyses of Challenge data, fitted biological models, or replacements for the official scoring rules.

| [Spatial Graph Connectivity Auditor](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/tools/spatial-components/) | Identify radius-graph components, component membership, degrees, and isolated points. |
| [Spatial kNN Distance Profiler](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/tools/spatial-knn/) | Summarize per-point k-th-neighbor distances to inspect local scale variation. |
| [Spatial Radius Stability Auditor](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/tools/spatial-radius-stability/) | Compare edge counts, isolates, degrees, and edge-set changes across increasing radii. |
| [Spatial Label Mixing Permutation Explorer](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/tools/spatial-label-permutation/) | Compare cross-label edge fraction with fixed-graph label shuffles that preserve label totals. |
| [Spatial Coordinate Collision Auditor](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/tools/coordinate-collisions/) | Find distinct cell IDs with exact or near-duplicate coordinates for source-data review. |
| [Spatial Nearest Different-Label Distance Reporter](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/tools/label-boundary-distance/) | Summarize each point’s distance to its nearest differently labeled point. |
| [Spatial Axis-Scale Sensitivity Auditor](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/tools/axis-scale-sensitivity/) | Measure how physical spacing factors change k-nearest-neighbor identities. |
| [Spatial Axis Slice Profiler](https://random-guy-05.github.io/vec-participation-workbench/tools/spatial-axis-slices/) | Profile point counts and label composition across equal-width coordinate-axis slices. |

## Scope

These utilities do not submit predictions, contact the Challenge, decide eligibility, give legal advice, or guarantee a score or award. The Board Coverage Planner computes only the formula in the Rules from the board rows entered by the user. The Generality mapper is an explanation aid, not an organiser ruling. The compute estimator reports matrix storage arithmetic, not actual peak RAM or runtime. Data-use requirements can depend on facts the checklist cannot assess.
